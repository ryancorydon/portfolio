            <h3>Project Financials Dashboard</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Developer (Project Takeover)</p>
            <p><strong>Tools:</strong> SQL, Tableau, Tableau Pulse</p>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Dashboard providing comprehensive insights into project financials, accounts receivables, labor allocation, and job-specific metrics. Initially inherited this project after two years of incomplete development, with over 90% of the work remaining.</p>

            <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed 15+ complex SQL queries to extract and transform job-level data.</li>
                <li>Created dynamic data sources and pipelines integrated directly with Tableau.</li>
                <li>Designed and implemented 25+ interactive Tableau visualizations showing live job progress, budget burn, and cost forecasting.</li>
                <li>Incorporated Tableau Pulse to alert Project Managers when key performance indicators fall below projections.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>The dashboard is now a mission-critical tool used daily by Project Managers to monitor project health, identify risk early, and take proactive actions based on real-time KPIs.</p>

            <h4>High-Level Analysis</h4>
            <p>This dashboard modernized how project financial data is consumed within the organization. By integrating automated data refreshes and real-time alerting, it replaced legacy static reporting with a dynamic decision-making platform. Adoption across departments has improved communication, accelerated financial reviews, and reduced unnoticed budget variances. This project demonstrates strong end-to-end data ownership—from ETL to UX—and highlights the impact of self-service analytics at scale.</p>

            <h3>Service Dashboard Menu</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Designer & Developer</p>
            <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Tableau, SQL, Tableau Server</p>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Redesigned the main Service Department’s reporting hub by creating a centralized Tableau dashboard that acts as a menu with tabbed navigation to over 40 service-related dashboards. The new solution consolidates reporting access into one interface with seamless navigation to specific reports through embedded links.</p>

            <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Architected a dashboard-driven menu system that replaced a static report list with interactive tabbed navigation.</li>
                <li>Integrated direct hyperlinks to 40+ live dashboards, grouped by category for intuitive access and user flow.</li>
                <li>Eliminated the need to publish and maintain 40 separate Tableau extract refresh schedules—now just one dashboard manages them all.</li>
                <li>Worked closely with service managers to ensure menu usability aligned with their workflows and information needs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>The Service Dashboard Menu became the go-to portal for all service-related reporting needs. It simplified access, drastically reduced data maintenance overhead, and ensured faster insights delivery by consolidating views into one centralized interface.</p>

            <h4>High-Level Analysis</h4>
            <p>This project highlights a transformative approach to Tableau dashboard deployment by shifting from high-friction, decentralized reporting to a low-maintenance, scalable hub model. By building a single interface that links to all relevant service dashboards, we eliminated redundant publishing processes and improved dashboard discoverability. The efficiency gains from moving to a one-extract system not only saved significant server resources but also reduced operational risk from extract failures. This project is a model for optimizing Tableau architecture and maximizing user adoption through design thinking, smart navigation, and centralized control.</p>
